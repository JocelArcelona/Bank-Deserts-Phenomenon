# Bank-Deserts-Phenomenon
The FED communities define a bank desert as a census tract without a bank branch located within it or within a certain radius from its population center. That radius is determined by the type of community:
2 miles for urban communities
5 miles for suburban communities
10 miles for rural communities.

# Objective
This bank deserts project aims to analyze and identify areas (by zipcode) with limited or no access to banking institutions
